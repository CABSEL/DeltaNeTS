DeltaNets is an extension of our previous method DeltaNet, which involves a single-step inference of gene regulatory network and gene targets from (time-series) transcriptional profiles. If steady-state gene expression data are applied, it is same as running DeltaNet. 
DeltaNeTS generates a perturbation score for each gene in every sample. For a given sample, the magnitude of a gene perturbation scores reflects the confidence that this gene is directly perturbed (for example, by drug or chemical compounds), while the sign reflects the nature of the perturbation (positive for gene induction, negative for gene repression).
